totally agree with you direktor and i am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers please if you can do your regular check ups of the articles concerning south slavic languages and make sure they re not presenting some misleading information i would just add to this that although the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so called pan yugoslav commonness this distaste should be expressed in a more civilized manner than creating some non acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the shtokavian speaking area or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the central south slavic system language at the templates featured in the articles about south slavic languages and dialects and most importantly that ridiculous pan yugo distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism should not by any mean be reflected in the language area because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its supporters can be no matter what their not supported by anyone in scientific world theories they may point out as their sources and at the end as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations here s the example of americans and canadians majority of canadians feel in a different extent a kind of aversion towards americans especially since the start of the george bush era in usa but still nobody says that canadians speak a different language than americans and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries this is a typical way of overcoming any kind of distaste in a human and civilized way all the other ways are just a shame for humanity best regards to you direktor and to your beautiful and cosmopolitan split and dalmatia best and cheerful greetings,0

latinos unidos hi i would just like to know if you can please help me with these two maricons what originally started as me trying to help a misinformed person about who latinos are has turned into a verbal war and i feel like i am being ganged up on by these two when i was only originally trying to help and then when i tried to fully explain the concept of latino to this individual i was further repaid with another warning the comments are on both of their user pages user talk jeffpw and user talk iamandrewrice aswell as my own,0

the davis source explains that although the original thunderclap plan called for massive continuous night day bombing effort the actual result was a restricted version so the term thunderclap is used informally to refer to the more limited actions against the eastern cities in february i am not sure we need to get into deep detail as long as we have references using the term,0
stop talking to me shut the fuck up you stupid cunt,1
it seems to me as well that there is no actual hipster subculture hipster is an insult if anything the article should be framed appropriately or not exist at all,0
